      <h3>Biography</h3>
      <p>Nikola Tesla was born in Smiljan, Croatia in 1856. He was an inventor, electrical engineer, mechanical engineer, and futurist best known for his contributions to the design of the modern alternating current (AC) electricity supply system.</p>
      <p>Tesla's patents and theoretical work helped form the basis of wireless communication and radio. His alternating current (AC) induction motor and related polyphase AC patents, licensed by Westinghouse Electric in 1888, earned him a considerable amount of money and became the cornerstone of the polyphase system which that company would eventually market.</p>
      <p>Tesla died impoverished and in obscurity on January 7, 1943, at the age of 86.</p>
